Arcade games list: [links](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EnczQAbBoLvo8sLIB_VGxdN71fGWoSalzMdueaiQk94/edit?usp=sharing) (some games remain incompatible with PS3).

## SNES expansion
Change the format of the names of the roms. Adopted the MAME Software List ROMs nomenclature, with it there will be no more ambiguity as each game is unique according to the system (possible subsystem) and name of the rom (rom set).
The roms for SNES (with ZIP extension) will be recognized only if placed in a folder named "snes" (case insensitive).
Package content:
* Libretro core SNES9X;
* Snaps and titles of snes games;
* Cheat file (.CHT), folder "/dev_hdd0/game/FBNE00123/USRDIR/core/cheats/Nintendo - Super Nintendo Entertainment System";
SNES games list: [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EvNi8Rbu-YrHunqkek1oqpUunzxQz8qQ95de6hfkryE/edit?usp=sharing).

## MEGADRIVE expansion
Compatibility with mega drive/genesis, megaCD/SegaCD and megaCDJ games.
Name format (mega drive with ZIP extension, megaCD/segaCD/megaCDJ with ISO or CUE / BIN or CHD extension) with the MAME Software List ROMs nomenclature.
The roms (mega drive, megaCD, segaCD and megaCDJ) will be recognized only if placed in a folder named "megadriv" (case insensitive).
Personally, I recommend the CHD format for all those games contained on a single CD, as they take about half the space of a normal ISO. There is a mame tool for converting ISO to CHD (see note at the end).
The MegaCD, SegaCD and MegaCDJ games require bios to be inserted in the system folder (/dev_hdd0/game/FBNE00123/USRDIR/cores/system) and are not included in the PKG. The names of the bios files MUST be:
* bios_CD_E.bin
* bios_CD_U.bin
* bios_CD_J.bin


Package content:
* Libretro core GENESIS PLUS GX;
* Snaps and titles of the mega drive/genesis, megaCD/SegaCD and megaCDJ games;
* Cheat files (.CHT), folders "/dev_hdd0/game/FBNE00123/USRDIR/core/cheats/Sega - Mega Drive - Genesis" and "/dev_hdd0/game/FBNE00123/USRDIR/core/cheats/Sega - Mega-CD - Sega CD";

MEGADRIVE games list: [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oBGlGMD-T8-07jFI7RgLZZQ9Ud7-RHp39uRgvduTi1A/edit?usp=sharing).

Note: CHD Archive Usage

lr-genesis-plus-gx has support for the CHD (V1-V5) archive format.
This format will save space and allow you to keep your Mega CD/Sega CD ROM folder tidy.
The following archive contains a MAME 0.205 version of CHDMAN and Windows batch files that can be used to quickly convert your Mega CD/Sega CD games to CHD (V5): [Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-ElaPpvBHs5aUd0QUM3c05kY2c/view?usp=sharing)

### What is FB Alpha Retro Loader ?

---

FB Alpha RL is a PS3 homebrew application coded from scratch,
and not based in any other public source code by other 
developers. It is a result of many hours of dedication
and research.

It is in no way a dirty hack of RetroArch or something 
similar. By the contrary, FB Alpha RL serves as a independent 
frontend to RetroArch and provides features not incorporated 
in it.

I did had to make a modified RetroArch core to be included
along my application, so it could process the arguments
or new commands that FB Alpha RL will be sending to it.

### Objective of FB Alpha RL (Retro Loader):

---

As a dev from the official FB Alpha Team, 
FB Alpha RL was made with a objective in mind, to
keep the original experience from the official
FB Alpha (for Windows OS) on the PS3 system.

Please, read the technical info for more details.

### Technical Info:

---

Signed for CFW 3.4X / 4.XX (should work for everyone).

Tested @ 1080p / 720p / 480p resolutions via HDMI.

FB Alpha RL uses a custom "burn_drivers.cpp" file
that was generated by modifying the official windows
version of FB Alpha with a routine to generate such
file on launch.

The file have a big structure with all the information
for all supported drivers in FB Alpha v0.2.97.30.

Information such as: 

- Romset Name (Ex. kof2002)
- Parent ROM (Ex. sf2)
- Year
- Manufacturer (Ex. Capcom)
- System (Ex. Neo Geo)
- Max players
- Game Screen Resolution
- Game Screen Aspect Ratio

Future release will have a custom generated file with 
all the ROM information as well, so the application will 
be able to verify every romset with precise CRC32 checks 
(as in the official FB Alpha for Windows).

NOTE: You don't need the official RetroArch installed,
this already has my own modified build incorporated
into FB Alpha RL installation directory. So you can safely
install the official RetroArch and it won't interfere.

 - MiraLaTijera 4.40 (3.2.0)
```

- Added version and IP address display on the Main Menu.

- Added proper "Preview" image aspect ratio calculation.

- Incorporated RetroArch and FBA libretro source code into
FB Alpha RL Git, and with just one makefile everything is 
built.

To build:
```
make fbarl
```

To clean (all cores):
```
make _cleanup
```

- Ported my custom mods to the latest RetroArch Core v0.9.9.6.

- (O) is the new "Game List" button to return to "Main Menu".
 
- Added shadow effect to all rendered text, in preparation
for future "Custom Theme" feature.

- Fixed a problem with CPS-3 External / Stereo sound on libretro, 
now it sounds great :)

- [src] Source code has been greatly re-organized.

- [src] "miniz.cpp" ZIP library is used the "proper" way, 
so now I can use its modules everywhere I need.

- [src] "burn_drivers.h" was renamed as "burn_drivers.cpp" and is 
now compiled, allowing access to its data everywhere I need.

- Added support for Neo-Geo UNI-BIOS (need to be present in neogeo.zip).

FBARL will look from latest (uni-bios_3_0.rom) to oldest BIOS (uni-bios_1_0.rom) 
in "neogeo.zip", of course if you don't have any of those the game will be 
loaded with regular BIOS.

- Added check for file existence on game selection, if the 
game listed is not found for some reason, like for example, 
if you disconnected the USB with the games, it will prompt 
you with a message to re-scan. The system will not lock / freeze 
anymore.

- Added check for fb_alpha.SELF core existence on game selection, if 
for some reason you don't have it or can't access, the application will 
let you know and prompt you to re-install it.

- Fixed libretro core default inputs for Neo-Geo and Capcom fighting games, 
now they are correctly assigned.

- Fixed the Save Custom Inputs feature on RetroArch core, now it will not 
include the annoying "example" text, it will use the currently loaded name, 
so you can save quickly and continue playing.

- Added FTP support.

- Using latest FB Alpha v0.2.97.30 source, adapted to compile as 
libretro (romset is synched with MAME v149).

- Doesn't include all "optimizations" from recent libretro Git, since some 
of them cause some problems with a few games.

1.02 (September 15, 2013)

- Updated with latest FBA Libretro Core (v0.2.97.28), it should
improve compatibility and emulation performance. If you had a
game that presented emulation problems, try it now, it might be
fixed on this release.

1.01a (February 15, 2013)(UPDATE)

- Added option to Enable / Disable display if missing games.
